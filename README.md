# MiceProteinExpression
A simple school project of training neural nets to predict three binary attributes (Down Syndrome, Memantine administration, Stimulation), from 77 protein expression levels.

script.r contains the R code.

report.rmd contains detailed report in Slovak. In the end, the same network is modified for experimental purposes to solve a different problem (predicting morphological labels).
